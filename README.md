I’m a systems-oriented game programmer working across Unity, Unreal, and C++. My projects focus on layered, modular gameplay mechanics (such as custom input systems), strategic AI/NPC behavior, Murim-style power progression, and data-driven UI.
 I build from first principles, handle the full dev stack (code, asset management, Git/LFS, mobile exports), and I thrive when solving hard problems like custom spawn scripting, overheat simulations, and rune-based magic systems.
Wins = Learning new insanity
ANTI-Wins: Frustration and not having understanding stuff! D=

🔭 I’m currently working on:
CorePulse (Android twin-stick shooter)
Project Sovereign (tactical RPG with runic magic and AI-generated NPCs).
**All systems are hand-built—no plug-and-play templates here.**

🌱 I’m currently learning:
Advanced C++ architecture (modern namespaces, linker/ODR hell), Unity mobile optimization (object pooling, GC, responsive touch controls), and how not to break everything whenever Gradle or Firebase updates.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on:
Gameplay systems, tactical AI, and procedural generation tools—especially enemy patterns, modular gear, or anything that needs more logic than flash.

🤔 I’m looking for help with:
Android playtesting, UI/UX feedback for loadout screens, and anyone with mystical knowledge of Unity 6’s Gradle setup. Will pay in existential memes.

💬 Ask me about:
Nothing! I’m just a humble beginner dev.
...Unless you want to talk about:
* Frustrating Unity bugs
* Why cats will conquer us all
* Or weird trivia, bad puns, and worse humor
